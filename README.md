Transpile it
---

Browserify and transpile es6 code for my own benefit. Move along.

Note: you are probably better off using jsbin because it has built in support for traceur and 6to5 compilers. I'm interested in interacting with the compiled output on the FS, but otherwise I just test things out on jsbin.
